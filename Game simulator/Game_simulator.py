Game Simulator
Started as an off-platform project for the CodeAcademy Python 3 course.
I've been adding to this project and improving it as I learn more about Python 3.

Planned improvements for the future:
Change error trapping for game_number so it allows for expansion of dictionaries offering new games
Error trap for running out of money - currently allows debt
Include a leader board
Create an improved user interface
Introduce a delay between each line of information appearing when the game is in play for added suspense!
